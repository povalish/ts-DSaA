This repository was created for storing 
Data Structures (that learned and explored).

All classes and interfaces created for production-ready uses.

- [Stack](#stack)


### Stack

Stack is a linear data structure. It follows the 
LIFO principle which is the last-in and first-out rule.

A real-life example is a stack of plates: you can only 
take a plate from the top of the stack, and you can 
only add a plate to the top of the stack.

##### Properties
- length

##### Methods
- push(e) -- putting an element into a stack
- pop() -- remove an element from a stack and returned removed element
- top() -- just get last element
- isEmpty() -- if Stack is empty
- isFull() -- if Stack is full (when using fixed size)
